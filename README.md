## Overview

### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- From the output of the linear model, we see that vehicle length and ground clearance has the highest impact on predicting mpg with very small p-values, a unit change in any one of these two variables results in a 6.267128 and 3.545534 increase in mpg respectively keeping all other factors constant
